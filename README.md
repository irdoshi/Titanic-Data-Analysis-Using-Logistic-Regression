# Titanic-Data-Analysis-Using-Logistic-Regression

- Loaded the Titanic dataset and performed basic sanity checks to ensure data integrity.
- Checked for missing values in important variables like pclass, survived, sex, and age.
- Identified the most important variables for survival analysis based on survivors' accounts, including pclass, sex, age, and survived.
- Created a new variable "child" to identify passengers younger than 14 years old.
- Converted the "pclass" variable to a categorical variable using the factor function.
- Estimated multiple logistic regression models to analyze the relationship between survival and various variables.
- Explored the relationship between survival and pclass, sex, and age individually.
- Examined the relationship between survival and age, pclass, and sex simultaneously.
- Interpreted the results of the logistic regression models, highlighting the significance of variables and their impact on survival.
- Analyzed the survival likelihood of young men (18-35) and compared it to other age groups.
- Summarized the findings and discussed the accuracy of survivors' accounts.
